Webskillet base theme

Mobile-first HTML5 base theme for Drupal 7

alpha1 release - December 2015

Features:
* regions for modals and side-reveals (just put blocks in the regions and links to them will open them as modals or reveals - if the user login block is put in either the modal or a reveal region, all links to /user/login will open the block, and the destination attribute will follow)
* dismissable messages
* fontAwesome icons
* responsive mobile navigation
* fastClick for smoother experience on mobile devices
* swipe support for mobile menu and reveals on touch devices
* pull-down submenus
* jQuery.validate validation of all forms by default (can be turned off)
* option to fix footer to the bottom of the window when page content isn't long enough (can be turned off)
* long text links that overflow their containers automatically shortened (can be turned off)
* external links open in new pages (can be turned off entirely or selectively, using jQuery selectors)
* classes for in-page scrolling section navigation
* custom css and js can be injected using theme settings
* javascript utilities for handling cookies, popups, fixing elements (such as headers) on scroll, equalizing height of a set of elements, scrolling within page, and vertical centering

Plays well with the following modules:
* __Hybridauth__: changes "Hybridauth Identities" to "Social Identities"

Roadmap:
* reponsive support for one or more mega-menu modules - intending to investigate [ultimenu](https://www.drupal.org/project/ultimenu)

Feature requests should be directed to [Jonathan Kissam](https://jonathankissam.wordpress.com/about/)
